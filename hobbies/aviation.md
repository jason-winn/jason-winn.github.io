  - title: "Toronto Flying"
    description: |
      After years of right-seat flights out of Buttonville (CYKZ), I trained and got my license at Toronto Island Airport (CYTZ) in 2012.

      My favourite Toronto flights are those that are out over cottage country.

      When I moved to Vancouver one of the first things I did was to get up flying. I fly out of Boundary Bay Airport (CZBB).

      My favourite spots to take passengers include: Widgeon Lake, Qualicum Beach (CAT4), and Squamish (CYSE). There are many other places I'm hoping to check out soon!
