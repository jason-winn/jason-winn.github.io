  - title: "Toronto Flying"
    description: |
      After years of passenger flights out of Buttonville (CYKZ), I trained and got my license at Toronto Island Airport (CYTZ) in 2012.

      My favourite Toronto flights are those up north of the city.

      When I moved to Vancouver one of the first things I did was to get up flying. I fly out of Boundary Bay Airport (CZBB).

      My favourite spots to take passengers are Widgeon Lake and Qualicum Beach (CAT4). There are many other places I'm hoping to check out soon!
