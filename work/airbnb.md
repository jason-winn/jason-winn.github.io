    description: |
      The layout of Airbnb's iOS app needed to be updated in time for the launch of the iPhone 6 (the first iPhone with a larger screen width).

      Before this work, a project search of 'width: 320' would've yielded a shocking number of results.

  - title: "Map Pin Clustering"
    description: |
      This prototype was built to explore what client-side map pin clustering could look like.

      A combination of quad-tree and k-means clustering were used to make the clustering feel more organic.

      A ground-up rewrite of the Chat screen for Airbnb's iOS app.

      It's no Slack, but to ask your Host where the plunger is, it seems to do the trick.
