			<p class="title-text">Creating a Smooth Messaging Experience</p>
			<p class="body-text modal-text-body">Airbnbâ€™s messaging is one of the most-used components of the app, yet it was not performing up to standards, and received many user complaints in the app store. This project was my own from the outset until completion. Smooth scrolling, particularly on older devices, was a high priority for me. In addition, I wanted a fluid message input, failure states for messages, saved message templates, and faster load times for long message threads.</p>
			
			<p class="title-text">The Solution</p>
			<p class="body-text modal-text-body">I implemented paginated loading of threads on the client alongside a more <b>intuitive caching policy</b>. For smooth scrolling I used <b>CoreGraphics draw code</b> to create chat bubbles and converted these into stretchable Bitmaps, which could be rendered extremely fast by older devices. Furthermore, I reduced layer blending wherever possible. Loading times were reduced by profiling the <b>layout subviews routine</b> and optimizing code for pre-determining cell sizes in the collection view.</p>
