			<p class="body-text modal-text-body">IBM was interested in applying iBeacons to meet their airline partners’ needs. This project was my own from the outset right through to completion. I was also responsible for presenting the system I had created to the airline executives. The premise is that a customer service rep in the airport has an iPad that now allows them to view where each passenger with the Air Canada iPhone or Android app is located in the airport, allowing them to push special offers, send push notifications to page passengers, and more.</p>
			
			<p class="title-text">The Solution</p>
			<p class="body-text modal-text-body">With an iBeacon at each gate, the <b>RSSI (received signal strength)</b> is measured and the corresponding beacon identifier is cross-referenced with the airline’s database of flights and gates. This then registers that the passenger has arrived at the gate for a particular flight. The portal was built using <b>AngularJS</b> as well as the <b>WebSockets protocol</b> to allow for instantaneous updates without the need for long polling. The passenger app uses <b>CoreLocation on iOS</b> and the <b>android.bluetooth APIs</b> on Android.</p>
