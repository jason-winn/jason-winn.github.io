      I studied Mechanical Engineering in school. Anything physics-related is a great time for me!

      I've built an autonomous line painter for road surfaces, an orientation-independent electrical plug, and more recently, a replica of a BendixKing KT-76a aircraft transponder.

      I've designed simple circuits for multiple projects I've worked on. I'm still a beginner, but enjoy the learning.

      Most circuits I've built leverage an Arduino, a relay, and some peripheral components. Shift registers have also helped reduce the burden of wiring.
